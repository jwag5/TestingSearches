<h4>About<h4>
<p>This program tests four different methods for finding and returning the k-th smallest element from an unsorted list. The first simply uses mergesort to sort the list and then returns list[k], theoretical O(n lgn). The second two use the Partition algorithm from the popular Quicksort until the pivot is at the kth index, at which point is stops and returns the value (one implemented iteratively and one recursively). They both have a theoretical best case time complexity of O(n) and theoretical worst case of O(n^2). The fourth algorithm is identical to the third except that is uses the Median of Median algorithm to pick a starting pivot and partitions the apropriate resulting subset, with a theoretical time complexity of O(n). The main driver averages the time is takes for each algorithm T times and displays the results of each.<P>
<h4>Note<h4>
<p>In my experimental results the iterative Partition sort (algorithm2) out performed all others for all testable values of n(I got up near half a million). However, my implementatinon of Algorithm 4 has some errors, at some values of K it inconsistently does not produce the correct results. I suspect is has to do with my recursive logic, but I have not had time to fix this error yet.<p>
